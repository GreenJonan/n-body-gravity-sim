#N-Body Gravity Simulation#

##About##
This project is a numerical simulation of the motion of objects given Newtonian forces acting on them.

###Forces###
The following forces that act on the bodies are,

 - [] Gravity 
 - [] Electric


The forces in general are inverse square laws,

that is, F = k \* b1 \* b2 / r^2 
where k force coefficient, b1 & b2 depend on objects 1 & 2, and r is the distance between the two objects
