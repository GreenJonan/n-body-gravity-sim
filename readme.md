# N-Body Gravity Simulation #

## About ##
This project is a numerical simulation of the motion of objects given Newtonian forces acting on them.

### Forces ###
The following forces that act on the bodies are,

 - [ ] Gravity 
 - [ ] Electric
 - [ ] Collision


The forces in general are inverse square laws,

that is, $F = k \* b1 \* b2 / r^2 $
where k force coefficient, b1 & b2 depend on objects 1 & 2, and r is the distance between the two objects.


The objects obeys Newton's laws, which means F = ma

The force an object experiences, depends on the sum of all the forces felt between itself and all the other objects. 
This may also be expressed in terms of the idea of fields, in that to calculate the sum of forces an object experiences, 'remove' the object and construct the field from all the remaining objects. The object then interacts with this field and experiences a force.
