FILE.sys is a file containing information about a system with the following format:

Comment out information using [comment] syntax.  Multiple comments can be placed inside one another.

General comments can be made outside the FILE{} object syntax.

TO-DOs are indicated by #

Names-Values are read verbatim when “key:val” is used, that is quote notation. The parser interprets this as (‘’,’key:val’), rather than (‘key’, ‘val’) as with key:val.


OBJECT {
	Properties of object
}


The following objects are:

root {

constants {
	G:value;
	E:value

	distanceError:value

	timeDelay:value
	updateNumber:value
	timeStep:value;
	;
	[obj :vector {1+(1+4)*2*2^(3e-2) }]
}



universe {
	dimension:value
	centre : vector{3e-2}
	resistance:bool
	(HI:BYE)
	conserveEnergy:bool
	
	body {
		X: vector {0,0,0}
		V : vector{0,0,0}

		mass:value
		charge:value
		radius:value

		colour:colour {1,2,3}
		name:string
		
		body { string }
	}
	
	body{
	}
}


#screen {
	width:value
	height:value
	scale:value

	background:colour
}

}



Note that, the order in which the names are specified is not important, nor is any extra white space (more than one space).


It is also possible to compute basic numeric operations:

 Addition:       +
 Subtraction:    -
 Multiplication: *
 Division:       /
 Exponentiation: ^
 #Modulus:        %


The following units are supported:
