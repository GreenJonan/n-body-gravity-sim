Graphical Issues:

1).

Zoom into moon, when the sun approaches certain points in it’s orbit, it appears to collide with earth/moon system. However, this is just a graphical issue. 
Zoom ~ 2^9, or ~2^10
Also, the angle between the earth and sun is about 30 & 45 (not 60!) degrees from each horizontal/vertical axis.

—> Fixed: 9/7/20, Stopped rendering objects when they are not on the screen.



2).

pygame.draw.circle(self.screen, body.colour, pix_centre, r)
OverflowError: signed integer is less than minimum

(-1260906465131, -292374324) in pixels

This implies that there exists values such that pygame is no longer able to draw objects.
—> Fixed: 9/7/20, stop drawing objects when their radius is larger than a standard non-long integer. Draw them as a single pixel.



3).

Objects that approach another object get flung out of their orbits. Error likely arises from the fact that the forces follow the inverse square law and approach infinity.


4).

Set universal speed limit to zero. Objects appear to still be able to move. This error occurs due to the runge-kutta method and the fact that kxn is effectively velocity due to the force. However, the velocity cannot exceed 0, and kxn may be non-zero.
